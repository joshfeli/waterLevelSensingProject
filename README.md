# waterLevelSensingProject
Our final project for MIT's 6.2300 Undergraduate Course, "Electromagnetic Waves & Applications", as taught in Spring 2023. Taught by Luca Daniel, Jelena Notaros, and Kevin O'Brien.

## About the project
At a high-level, our aim was to develop sensing technology toward creating a smart water bottle. Our initial proposal and final report describe the project and its results in much greater detail, both of which are included in this repository. Also included are the code we used to plot our results and to calculate the expected resonant frequency.

Many thanks to the instructors of 6.2300 for providing inspiriation for our final project. We based this off of the final lab assignment for the course, and the professors walked us through a new way to think about the components involved in that lab.

The project proposal and the final report are both linked in this repository.

Thank you!
